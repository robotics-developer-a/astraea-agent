### An agent of order and precision

![screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

**Astraea** is a terminal-native AI coding agent that resolves disorder — it doesn't just write code, it imposes structure on any problem that arrives with ambiguity, inefficiency, or unchecked complexity.

Built from the ground up on [**Bun**](https://bun.com), with a React Ink TUI, multi-provider model support, sub-agents, scheduling, and a permission system you can actually trust.

## 1 · Introduction

In Greek mythology, **Astraea** was the goddess of justice and innocence — the last immortal to walk among humans during the Golden Age. When the world fell into chaos, she did not abandon it out of despair; she stayed until the very end, imposing order on disorder. She ascended not because she gave up, but because she had done everything that could be done.

**Astraea** the agent inherits that mission. It is a general-purpose AI agent for any task with high logical density — software engineering, system design, contract analysis, decision decomposition, research, process planning, or any domain where clear reasoning and verified facts outperform intuition. It operates through structured reasoning: it reaches for a tool before it speculates, and follows a defined path before it improvises.

It runs in your terminal as either a **persistent REPL** (multi-turn, React Ink UI) or a **single-shot CLI** (great for pipes and scripts), and can run **headless** as a scheduled daemon.

### Why Astraea

| | |
|---|---|
| **Multi-provider** | First-class support for **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, and local **Ollama** — switch with a single env var. |
| **Five session modes** | `default` · `orbit` (read-only planning) · `cruise` (auto-accept edits) · `forge` (bypass prompts) · `counsel` (confirm direction first). |
| **Permission system** | A mode × behavior matrix with hard **red-lines** that can never be bypassed — auto-approve the safe, always gate the dangerous. |
| **Rich tool suite** | Files, shell (Bash + PowerShell), web (fetch / search / headless browser), LSP, MCP resources, and skills. |
| **Extensible** | Drop-in **skills** (`SKILL.md`), **MCP** servers (stdio / http / sse), and installable **plugins** that bundle both — see [§4](#4--skills-mcp--plugins). |
| **Sub-agents** | Spawn worker agents, message peers, and fan out complex work — coordination tools included. |
| **Vigil scheduling** | Schedule one-off or recurring agent tasks that run headless via a background daemon. |
| **Memory & compaction** | Persistent file-based memory injection, prompt-cache-aware system prompts, and automatic context compaction. |
| **WeChat integration** | Read and write WeChat conversations through driven automation. |
| **Web search** | Pluggable providers — **Tavily**, **Brave**, or **Exa** semantic search. |

## 2 · Quick Install

Astraea runs on [Bun](https://bun.com) (v1.3+). If you don't have it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anxelswanz/astraea-agent.git astraea
# or via SSH
# git clone git@github.com:anxelswanz/astraea-agent.git astraea
cd astraea
bun install
```

Register the global `astraea` command (one-time). This symlinks the CLI into `~/.bun/bin`, which Bun's installer adds to your `PATH`:

```bash
bun link
```

Now you can launch Astraea from anywhere by typing `astraea`. (Prefer not to link? You can always run it in-place with `bun run repl` — see [Getting Started](#3--getting-started).)

Configure your provider. Copy the example env and add a key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
# .env  — pick one provider
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxx     # default
# PROVIDER=openai
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# PROVIDER=ollama                          # fully local, no key needed
# OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b
```

> **Tip:** Personal API keys (search providers, etc.) can live in a global `~/.astraea/.env`, so every Astraea project reuses them and you never risk committing a secret. Create it with `mkdir -p ~/.astraea`.

Optional — enable web search by adding one of these to `~/.astraea/.env`:

```bash
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-xxx        # 1,000 req/mo, built for AI agents (recommended)
# BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=BSA-xxx # 2,000 req/mo
# EXA_API_KEY=xxx              # 1,000 req/mo, semantic search for research
```

## 3 · Getting Started

### Launch the interactive REPL

The primary way to use Astraea — a persistent, multi-turn React Ink UI. If you ran `bun link` during install, just type:

```bash
astraea
```

Otherwise, run it in-place from the project directory:

```bash
bun run repl
# or directly
bun run src/repl.tsx
```

You'll see the active provider and model printed on startup, then a prompt. Just start talking:

```
astraea › refactor src/query.ts to extract the streaming loop into its own module
```

### One-shot CLI

Ask a single question and get a single answer — ideal for scripts and pipes:

```bash
# direct argument
bun run src/cli.ts "explain what src/services/compact does"

# pipe mode
echo "summarize the changes on this branch" | bun run src/cli.ts
```

### Session modes

Switch how much autonomy Astraea has. Each mode trades convenience for caution:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `default` | Standard prompts — asks before writing files or running shell commands. |
| `orbit` | **Read-only planning.** Writes are blocked; Astraea reads, searches, and presents a plan for approval. |
| `cruise` | File writes auto-approved; shell still asks. |
| `forge` | Auto-accepts all changes, skipping prompts — red-lines still block. |
| `counsel` | Confirms direction with you (AI-driven questionnaire) before executing. |

### Scheduled & headless tasks (Vigil)

Run the scheduler daemon, which executes recurring agent tasks in the background:

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts --daemon          # start the scheduling daemon
```

Tasks are dispatched as isolated headless agents — no UI, full tool access.

### WeChat automation

```bash
bun run setup:wechat                 # one-time setup
bun run wechat:stop                  # signal the reader to stop at the next checkpoint
```

### Project scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run repl` | Launch the interactive Ink REPL |
| `bun run cli` | Run the single-shot CLI |
| `bun test` | Run the test suite (`bun:test`) |
| `bun run typecheck` | Type-check with `tsc --noEmit` |

## 4 · Skills, MCP & Plugins

Astraea has three ways to extend what it can do. They are independent subsystems that converge on the same internal pipelines — a skill from a plugin and a skill you hand-wrote become the *same* object; an MCP server from a plugin and one you added by hand flow through the *same* config merge.

> **Mental model:** the **skill system** owns all skills and the **MCP system** owns all MCP servers. Plugins are just one *supplier* that delivers skills/servers into those systems — exactly equal to dropping a file yourself.

### 4.1 Skills — Markdown operating manuals

A **skill** is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. When invoked, its content is injected as instructions for the model to follow. Skills live in:

| Scope | Path | Precedence |
|-------|------|------------|
| user | `~/.astraea/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | **wins** on name clash |
| project | `<repo>/.astraea/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | overridden by user |

**SOP — add a skill:**

```bash
mkdir -p .astraea/skills/code-review
$EDITOR .astraea/skills/code-review/SKILL.md
```

```markdown
---
description: review a diff for bugs and security issues   # required — the only common field
when_to_use: when the user asks for a code review         # optional, appended in the menu
allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Bash]                          # optional, additive permissions
argument-hint: "[path]"                                    # optional, shown in the slash picker
model: claude-opus-4-8                                     # optional, per-invocation model override
---

# Code Review
Walk the diff, flag correctness bugs first, then security, then style…
```

> The folder name **is** the skill name. Only `<name>/SKILL.md` is recognized — a bare `.md` file is skipped.

**SOP — invoke a skill** (two entrances, same result):

| Entrance | How | Gated by |
|----------|-----|----------|
| **You** | type `/code-review [args]` in the REPL (autocompletes after `/`) | `user-invocable: false` hides it |
| **The model** | it picks from a 1-line "skill menu" injected each turn (progressive disclosure) and calls the `Skill` tool itself | `disable-model-invocation: true` hides it |

On invocation, the skill's `allowed-tools` and `model` apply to that turn only.

### 4.2 MCP — external tools via the Model Context Protocol

MCP servers give the model **real callable tools** (read a database, query Sentry, …). They run as isolated processes/connections; their tools appear to the model as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`.

**SOP — add a server** with `astraea mcp add`:

```bash
# Remote (HTTP) — needs --transport http; second arg is a URL
astraea mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# Remote + static auth header
astraea mcp add --transport http corridor https://app.corridor.dev/api/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Local (stdio is the default; everything after -- is the subprocess command)
astraea mcp add filesystem npx -- -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--transport / -t` | `stdio` (local, default) · `http` · `sse` (remote) |
| `-e KEY=val` | environment variable for a **stdio** subprocess |
| `-H "Header: val"` | auth header for a **remote** server |
| `--scope` | `local` (default) · `project` · `user` |

```bash
astraea mcp list            # show configured servers
astraea mcp remove sentry   # delete one
```

Inside the REPL, `/mcp` shows live connection status. Config is stored per scope: project → `.mcp.json` (commit it), user → `~/.astraea/settings.json`, local → `.astraea/settings.local.json`.

> **Restart to apply.** Servers connect at startup; changing config means restarting the session. Remote auth is static headers only in v1 (no OAuth yet).

### 4.3 Plugins — package & distribute skills + MCP

A **plugin** bundles skills and MCP servers into one installable, versioned unit. Distribution follows a *marketplace* model: a plugin always lives on a "shelf" (`marketplace.json`), and `install` only installs shelf items. v1 supports **local directory** marketplaces (offline).

**SOP — make & install a local plugin:**

```
my-shelf/
├── .astraea-plugin/marketplace.json     # the shelf: lists plugins
└── db-tools/                            # the plugin
    ├── .astraea-plugin/plugin.json      # manifest
    └── skills/query-db/SKILL.md         # auto-detected; no need to declare it
```

```jsonc
// my-shelf/.astraea-plugin/marketplace.json
{ "name": "my-shelf",
  "plugins": [ { "name": "db-tools", "source": "./db-tools" } ] }
```

```jsonc
// my-shelf/db-tools/.astraea-plugin/plugin.json
{ "name": "db-tools", "version": "0.3.0",
  "mcpServers": { "pg": { "type": "http", "url": "https://pg.example/mcp" } } }
// skills/ is detected by convention — declaring "skills" is optional
```

```bash
astraea plugin marketplace add ./my-shelf   # subscribe to the shelf
astraea plugin install db-tools             # materialize into the versioned cache
# the plugin's skills join the skill menu; its MCP servers connect on next start
```

**Lifecycle** (state is separated — files vs. the enabled flag):

```bash
astraea plugin list                 # installed plugins
astraea plugin disable db-tools     # flip a boolean — keeps files
astraea plugin enable  db-tools
astraea plugin uninstall db-tools   # remove record + cached files
astraea plugin marketplace list     # subscribed shelves
```

Inside the REPL, `/plugin` shows installed plugins and shelves. Plugins are stored under `~/.astraea/plugins/` (relocate with `ASTRAEA_PLUGINS_DIR`). When a plugin's skill or server clashes with one you wrote by hand, **yours wins** (`manual > plugin`).

> v1 wires plugin **skills + mcpServers** only. Remote marketplaces (git/npm), auto-update, and other contribution types are planned. **Restart to apply** install/enable changes.
