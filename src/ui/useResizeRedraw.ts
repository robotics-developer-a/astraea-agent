// useResizeRedraw — trigger a single full-screen redraw whenever the terminal is resized.
//
// Why it's needed: Ink's <Static> is append-only — the scrollback history lines it has already
// committed are never repainted. After a terminal resize those old lines re-wrap to the new
// column width, but Ink can't erase frames it already committed, so the history ghosts/misaligns
// and the hand-drawn input-box border breaks too. The fix is to clear the screen + remount
// <Static> on resize, re-rendering all history at the new size (see App's wipeStatic).
//
// Why it's debounced: dragging a window edge fires dozens of resize events. useWindowSize()
// already listens for those internally; here we only react to the columns/rows values it produces
// — a timer (default 150ms) collapses a whole drag into a single trailing onResize. Each further
// size change during the window clears the pending timer and restarts it, so we fire only once
// the drag settles.
//
// Extracted into its own hook (rather than inlined in App) so the "skip mount frame + debounce +
// ignore unchanged dims + clean up on unmount" logic — which has a few edge cases — can be
// unit-tested in isolation (see useResizeRedraw.test.tsx).
